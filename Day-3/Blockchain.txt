INTRODUCTION TO BLOCKCHAIN:
-“Blockchain technology” is a transparent and freely accessible record which enables us to safely transfer the ownership of value using public-key encryption.
-Blockchain technology uses a decentralized consensus mechanism to keep up the system, which means isn’t constrained by a bank, corporation, or government. 
-Bigger the network develops and turns out to be progressively decentralized, it becomes more secure.
-It has increased a great deal for consideration in an assortment of businesses like foundations and charities, E-Commerce and Financial Services.

-Since there’s no exact central location, it is harder to hack the information as it exists simultaneously in millions of locations.
-Blockchain technology was invented in 2008
WHY BLOCKCHAIN?:
-A block is a record of new transactions. 
-At the point when a block is completed, it’s added to the chain.
- Bitcoin holders have a system key as the private password to the location on the chain, this is where their ownership is recorded.
- Crypto-currency advocates like distributed storage without a middle man. 
-You needn’t bother with a bank to confirm the exchange of cash or take a cut of the exchange.
